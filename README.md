# ORM-Ecommerce-Backend

## Description

In this project I wanted to create a backend e-commerce website so that a user can use the latest technologies and be able to compete with other companies. They will have the ability to get, post, delete, and put data all from products in different categories. They have all been linked in the database using models. During this project I learned how to create put request, and how to structure them in my code.
